    "### `get_tests`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `get_tests` method accepts two parameters: `start_date` and `pageno`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The **`start_date`** parameter specifies the date to be plugged into the `TestFromUtc` parameter of the `/tests` API input. This allows the function to retrieve data starting from the specified date.\n",
    "- The **`pageno`** parameter indicates which page of data to fetch from the endpoint.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure provides an intuitive way to interact with the API, as it retrieves tests starting from a certain date and paginates through the results. However, you could modify the function to include additional parameters like:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`TestToUtc`**: Specifies the end date for filtering tests.\n",
    "- **`ModifiedFromUtc`**: Filters tests based on the date they were last modified.\n",
    "- **`GroupUnderTestId`**: Filters tests by specific group IDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "These parameters can enhance flexibility depending on your specific implementation needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Functionality\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Access Token Retrieval**:\n",
    "   - The method starts by attempting to get the access token using the `get_access_token` function. If it fails to retrieve the token, it prints an error message and exits the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **API URL Construction**:\n",
    "   - An API URL, `api_url` is constructed using the provided `start_date` and `pageno`, formatted as a query string.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fetching Tests Data**:\n",
    "   - The method calls the `fetch_data` function with the constructed API URL and authorization headers to retrieve the tests data. If the response is empty (i.e., `None`), it returns an empty DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Group Names Retrieval**:\n",
    "   - The method then constructs a second API URL to fetch group names associated with the tenant. It creates a mapping of group IDs to group names for later use.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Concurrent Data Fetching for Profiles**:\n",
    "   - Using a `ThreadPoolExecutor`, it concurrently fetches profile data for each test in the `tests_data` using the `fetch_data` method. This is done to improve efficiency by making multiple requests in parallel.\n",
    "   - As each profile data is retrieved, it adds the `Name` (composed of given and family names) and the associated `Groups` (derived from group IDs) to each test record.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Flattening Nested JSON**:\n",
    "   - The method includes a nested function, `flatten_json`, which is responsible for transforming nested JSON structures into a flat dictionary format. This is useful for converting complex data into a more manageable format.\n",
    "   - The method calls this function on each record in the `tests_data` to create a list of flattened records.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **DataFrame Creation**:\n",
    "   - Finally, it converts the flattened data into a pandas DataFrame and prints a completion message before returning the DataFrame."
